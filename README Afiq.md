This is my group project together with my groupmate, all design are made by my friend Syahrul as he is frontend dev, I only focus fully on backend development, however some js(I only know basic) are made by me such as in the subscription package. 

However i dont create database migration here, thats too bad, database was use using pgsql and host using heroku.

If you notice in resources>view, there is frame and frameT, that is acronymm to frameTesting and frame for production. When using heroku somehow secure_asset() need to be use and only asset() work in local host. I think thats all from me. Thank you for visiting !!
